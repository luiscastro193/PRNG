# PRNG
Extremely simple yet highly reliable and reproducible Pseudo Random Number Generator with seed. Implementation in JavaScript using native APIs.

If performance is an issue, a faster alternative with good properties can be found in [fastPRNG.js](fastPRNG.js) (check the [original repository](https://github.com/cristian-5/pcg-random-wasm) for credits and license).

# PRNG
Extremely fast yet highly reliable and reproducible Pseudo Random Number Generator with seed. Implementation in JavaScript and Python using native APIs and [WebAssembly PCG](https://github.com/cristian-5/pcg-random-wasm).

Check [test.js](test.js) for benchmarks and [distributions.js](distributions.js) for bounded distributions with normal-like shape.
